We provide scripts for our collaborative research project on how to estimate performance of a transferred model using unlabeled data. The rationale for this project is that there is often reason to assume that model performance will be substantially worse in a new setting, but how much worse is very hard to estimate until new outcome data is collected. When outcomes are long term this process will require substantial amount of time, and potentially wasted, resources. Feature data starts however to accumulate long before outcomes are observed. In such cases it would be truly useful to be able to reliably estimate future model performance based on feature data alone. Therefore, we aim to assess and compare different methods of estimating model performance using only feature data when transferring a model to a new setting. The data we use are available from [https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.d22q6vh](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.d22q6vh).
